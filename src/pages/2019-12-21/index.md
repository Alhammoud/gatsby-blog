So, at the end of 2018 I wrote this article: [2018: Reflections on trying to start an internetÂ business](https://maxrozen.com/2018/12/31/2018-review-starting-an-internet-business), at the end of which I promised I would:

- Launch OnlineOrNot, the GraphQL monitoring solution
- Go camping more
- Sell some camera gear

How did I do? Well:

## On the personal side

I worked at Expert360 as a full-time employee, working on the React frontend. After speeding up their frontend's performance (Time to Document Complete) by 75% and scrapping the microfrontend architecture in favour of a monolithic React app to save 4 seconds on each page load, I decided to go off in search of bigger and better challenges.

I ended up working for a large Australian marketing/advertising business, and yet again found myself working at a company that advertised a job description that didn't meet the reality of what the business needed.

I've got a few things planned for this blog, so it was about time I had a system
that didn't just involve creating a gross django page in Mezzanine (v1) or
creating a ES6 class in React (v2) with custom code to say where code should go.

So here's v3 of my blog, written in Markdown, and served by
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

My aim is to just post things I find in my day to day which solve problems that
others may face. For example,
[this solution](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/1679#issuecomment-307016615)
in the popular Reactjs library
[react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) which I will write
about in my next post.

So I recently had to learn TypeScript - here's a list of resources I used.

The biggest recommendation I can give is to dump Atom, and use VS Code. (I know, *I know*. Atom is amazing, but VS Code's native support for TypeScript makes it a no brainer for getting started with your codebase.)

I initially reviewed an article on [Understanding JavaScript function invocation and `this`](https://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/), then I started reading through the TypeScript handbook. There are some quirks that you only really understand by writing code and trying to debug issues, so I recommend skimming the following links and coming back to them when you have warnings from your IDE/Code editor.

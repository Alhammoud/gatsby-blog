excerpt: "A hyperlocal social network for the suburbs"
---

This app was written as part of a Positive Computing course at the University of
Sydney. Our assignment was to create an application that would help better
society. I ended up joining a group of talented developers and together we
decided the best way to achieve this goal was to create yet another social
network

Here's a Youtube video we came up with to promote the project:

So in the end the idea was to improve neighbourhood interactions by creating a
place for neighbours to chat, post events, share power tools and just hang out.

On the technical side, it was written in Java using Spring MVC with Hibernate
ORM, and a MySQL database. Ironically enough, login was provided by Facebook.js
OAuth2.

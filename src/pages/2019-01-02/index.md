### How I read:

I used to absolutely suck at reading books (and I still do, come to think of it). The whole having a physical book in your hands thing, trying to find a comfortable position to read just before going to sleep while your elbows are going numb - so annoying. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely love the physical act of reading, I just sucked at making it a habit, and being comfortable while reading.

Then I discovered podcasts, which eventually lead me to Audible. Instead of reading 3-4 books a year (mostly while on flights/trains to holiday destinations), I now read around 14-16. I typically listen while commuting to work, though occasionally while doing household chores I'll also put on a book. You'd be surprised how quickly those 30 minute commutes add up!

### The books that didn't make it

A few books I bought either didn't resonate with me, or the narration was atrocious - so I just returned them. The books below are only the ones I actually wanted to finish reading.
